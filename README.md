
# Fifty Days of Java  
A collection of 50 beginner-to-intermediate Java projects built over the course of fifty (non-consecutive) days. This repository is designed to strengthen core Java skills through hands-on practice and incremental complexity.

## 📌 About the Project
The goal of this challenge is simple:  
- Build **50 Java projects** in **50 days** (flexible schedule, non-consecutive).  
- Cover fundamental concepts like **variables, loops, arrays, OOP, data structures and collections, file handling**, and gradually move toward more advanced topics and framework use.

## ✅ What’s Included So Far
- **Tip Calculator** – Simple arithmetic and user input handling (with a slight sprinkle of humour).
- **JanKenPon (Rock, Paper, Scissors)** – Randomization and conditional logic.
- **Password Generator** – Arrays, Collections, loops, and randomness.
- **OOP Hangman Game** – Object-Oriented Programming, encapsulation, and modular design.
- **Caesar Cypher** - Object-Oriented Programming, Circular List with LinkedList, encapsulation, and modular design.
- *(More projects coming soon!)*

## 🎯 Goals
- Practice **Java syntax and fundamentals**.
- Learn **problem-solving through coding challenges**.
- Build a **portfolio of mini-projects** for future reference.
